Swerving away from the story of Brian and Dom, the film follows a completely new set of characters led by Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), a student forced to move to Japan to avoid jail time.\\n\\nHere are the movies in chronological order:\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001) 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) Fast & Furious (2009) Fast Five (2011) Fast & Furious 6 (2013) The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) Furious 7 (2015) The Fate of the Furious (2017) Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019) F9 (2021) Fast and Furious 10 (2023)\\n\\nTokyo Drift also marks the first appearance of Han Lue, a fan favourite who (SPOILER ALERT) appeared to be killed in a chase near the end of the film.\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nFortunately, Universal decided Han was so popular he would be resurrected with a clever workaround: all subsequent Fast films would be set before Toyko Drift.\\n\\nThis meant Han was able to return alive and well in Fast & Furious, the next film in the franchise.\\n\\nFast and Furious timeline\\n\\nJust to make things even more complicated, the Fast and Furious franchise also features several high-speed prequels, sequels and midquels. Most of these shorts were created for DVD releases of the original movies, shining light on unknown areas of the high-speed saga’s timeline.\\n\\nMore like this\\n\\nFirst released on the DVD of 2 Fast 2 Furious (the next film on this list), the short film Turbo-Charged Prelude shows exactly how Brian (Paul Walker) went from being an LAPD cop to criminal. The reason is the one you’d expect: after assisting Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) evade law enforcement, Brian himself becomes a wanted man.\\n\\nLos Bandoleros, the next short film, focuses on Dom and was served up to fans via a DVD bonus feature. No, it doesn’t explain how Brian became a fully-fledged FBI agent by the next film but does introduce audiences to Han (Sung Kang), Rico (Don Omar) and Tego (Tego Calderon). Including all of these mini-movies, the Fast and Furious timeline looks like this:\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious\\n\\nTurbo-Charged Prelude\\n\\n2 Fast 2 Furious\\n\\nLos Bandoleros\\n\\nFast & Furious\\n\\nFast Five\\n\\nFast & Furious 6\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\n\\nFurious 7\\n\\nThe Fate of the Furious\\n\\nFast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw\\n\\nF9\\n\\nHow to watch the Fast and Furious movies: release order\\n\\nIf you’re new to the Fast and Furious, sticking to the simplest route may be the best. After all, most of the movies follow a chronological order, with only really the third instalment in the franchise, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), causing some confusing pile-ups in the timeline as discussed.\\n\\nHere\\'s how you watch Fast & Furious movies in order of release:\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001) 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) Fast & Furious (2009) Fast Five (2011) Fast & Furious 6 (2013) Furious 7 (2015) The Fate of the Furious (2017) Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019) F9 (2021) Fast and Furious 10 (2023)\\n\\nFor all of the details on the released films and how to watch them, see below.\\n\\n1. The Fast and the Furious (2001)\\n\\nVin Diesel (L) and Paul Walker in The Fast and the Furious\\n\\nStarring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, Chad Lindberg, Johnny Strong, Ted Levine.\\n\\nThe first episode in the saga, The Fast and the Furious (2001), follows undercover cop Brian O\\'Conner (Paul Walker), who integrates himself into a heist crew run by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel).\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon\\n\\n2. 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\\n\\nStarring: Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Eva Mendes, Cole Hauser, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, James Remar.\\n\\n2 Fast 2 Furious doesn\\'t feature Vin Diesel, but it does star Walker and follows on from the events of The Fast and the Furious. This one introduces Ludacris as Tej and Tyrese Gibson as Roman, who went on to become two main characters.\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon\\n\\n3. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)\\n\\nStarring: Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Nathalie Kelley, Sung Kang, Brian Tee.\\n\\nThis is where things take a turn. This one was seen as a \\'reboot\\' of sorts for the whole franchise. There was no Paul Walker or Diesel (outside of a minor cameo)... or Ludacris, or Michelle Rodriguez, or Gibson. Basically no core characters here. The movie was set in Japan and featured Han (Sung Kang). Luckily, fans took to Han, but the movie did confuse the timeline somewhat.\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon\\n\\n4. Fast & Furious (2009)\\n\\nStarring: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz, Gal Gadot, Laz Alonso.\\n\\nNot to be confused with the first film in the franchise (these titles are confusing!) this one comes fourth. Set after 2 Fast 2 Furious, we ignore The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift for now.\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon\\n\\n5. Fast Five (2011)\\n\\nStarring: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Sung Kang, Tego Calderon, Don Omar, Gal Gadot, with Dwayne Johnson, and Matt Schulze.\\n\\nThe Rock first appears in Fast Five as Luke Hobbs, and we finally see Ludacris and Tyrese return to the franchise. Sung Kang also appears as Han – and Gal Gadot pops up too. The movies start ramping up and steering into the ridiculousness here.\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon\\n\\n6. Fast & Furious 6 (2013)\\n\\nStarring: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Luke Evans, Gina Carano, John Ortiz.\\n\\nWe have a new villain introduced, or a whole villain family with Luke Evans starring as Owen Shaw. We also have a post-credits scene to introduce Jason Statham\\'s character Deckard Shaw, who appears to kill Han in a scene first glimpsed in Tokyo Drift. Now we\\'ve caught up – phew.\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon\\n\\n7. Furious 7 (2015)\\n\\nStarring: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, with Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham.\\n\\nThe team reunite for this one that sees us say goodbye to Paul Walker. Statham is back after that credits scene for his first proper starring role in the FF franchise which saw him clash with Diesel and The Rock.\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon\\n\\nTake a look at our When is Black Friday 2022 explainer, for the latest news and advice on when to start your shopping this year.\\n\\n8. The Fate of the Furious (2017)\\n\\nVin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Charlize Theron as Cipher in The Fate of the Furious 2017 Universal City Studios Productions LLLP\\n\\nStarring: Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Scott Eastwood, Nathalie Emmanuel, Elsa Pataky, with Kurt Russell, and Charlize Theron.\\n\\nWe carry on the franchise with this eighth movie. We say hello to Charlize Theron here as villain Cipher. This marks the first instalment without Paul Walker\\'s Brian and also introduces us to a new member of Dom\\'s clan.\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon\\n\\n9. Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw (2019)\\n\\nStarring: Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Idris Elba, Vanessa Kirby, Cliff Curtis, and Helen Mirren.\\n\\nA little detour here, as it\\'s not really part of the core franchise, but a spin-off. The Rock and Statham return to team up against Idris Elba\\'s super-soldier. Shaw transitions from villain to hero. Vanessa Kirby also stars as Statham\\'s sister Hattie, while Helen Mirren reprises her role as their mother following a cameo in the eighth Fast and Furious film.\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon\\n\\n10. F9 (2021)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nStarring: Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, with Helen Mirren, with Kurt Russell, and Charlize Theron.\\n\\nIn the most recent instalment of The Fast Saga, Dominic and Letty find their retirement interrupted as a dangerous new threat emerges: Dom\\'s younger brother, Jakob Toretto, played by John Cena.\\n\\nDwayne Johnson is absent from this film, but we do get the return of Charlize Theron as Cipher and Helen Mirren as Queenie Shaw.\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon\\n\\n11. Fast X\\n\\nFast & Furious 9 - Han and Dom Universal\\n\\nStarring: Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, Scott Eastwood, Michael Rooker, Charlize Theron, Cardi B, Jason Momoa, Daniela Melchior, Brie Larson, Alan Ritchson, and Rita Moreno.\\n\\nThe tenth and penultimate film in the main Fast and Furious series will be due in 2023.\\n\\nThe film will see Jason Statham return to the main franchise as Deckard Shaw, whilst also introducing new stars to the series in the form of Jason Momoa as a villain and Oscar winners Brie Larson and Rita Moreno.\\n\\nCharlize Theron will also return as the recurring antagonist and hacker Cipher.\\n\\nWe wouldn\\'t be surprised if this one ends in a cliffhanger ahead of the eleventh film.\\n\\nFast X to be released in cinemas on 19th May 2023.\\n\\nWhere to watch the Fast and Furious movies\\n\\nUntil recently, most of the Fast and Furious franchise could be viewed on streaming service NOW with a cinema pass (£11.99 a month), however, the majority of the films have now left the platform – with only Furious 7 (2015) remaining.\\n\\nNone of the franchise is available on Netflix.\\n\\nAs for the first 6 films and the Fate of the Furious, all of these are available to stream for free on Prime Video for subscribers but you can rent or purchase F9 and Hobbs & Shaw of Amazon Prime Video, with prices ranging from £2.49 to £4.99.\\n\\nThe director\\'s cut of Fast and Furious 9 is also available on the service.\\n\\nThe Fast and Furious films are available to watch and buy/rent on Amazon Prime Video – try Amazon Prime Video for free for 30 days.\\n\\nIf you’re looking for something else to watch check out our TV Guide or Streaming Guide, or visit our dedicated Film hub.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTry Radio Times magazine today and get 12 issues for only £1 with delivery to your home – subscribe now.

The films are distributed by Universal Pictures.\\n\\nThe first film, based on the 1998 Vibe magazine article \"Racer X\" by Ken Li and written by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer, was released in 2001. It began the original tetralogy of films focused on illegal street racing, which culminated in the film Fast & Furious (2009). The series transitioned towards heists and spying with Fast Five (2011), which was followed by five sequels in that genre, the most recent of which, Fast X, was released on May 19, 2023.\\n\\nUniversal expanded the series to include the spin-off film Hobbs & Shaw (2019), while its subsidiary DreamWorks Animation followed this with the six-season animated streaming television series Fast & Furious Spy Racers (2019–2021). Soundtrack albums have been released for all the films, as well as compilation albums containing existing music heard in the films. Two short films that tie into the series have also been released.\\n\\nThe series has been commercially successful. It is Universal\\'s biggest franchise and the seventh highest-grossing film series, with a combined gross of over $7 billion.[2] Critical reception for the first four films was mixed until the fifth and later films, which were more positively received. Outside of the films, Fast & Furious has been the focus of other media, including attractions at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida, live shows, commercials, toys, and video games.\\n\\nFilms [ edit ]\\n\\nReleased [ edit ]\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001) [ edit ]\\n\\nBrian O\\'Conner, an LAPD officer, goes undercover in the street racing world to investigate a group of unknown truck hijackers, believed to be led by Dominic Toretto.\\n\\n2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) [ edit ]\\n\\nBrian O\\'Conner and Roman Pearce team up to go undercover for the U.S. Customs Service to bring down drug lord Carter Verone in exchange for the erasure of their criminal records.\\n\\nThis is the only film in the main series without Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto.\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) [ edit ]\\n\\nHigh school car enthusiast Sean Boswell is sent to live in Tokyo with his father and finds solace in the city\\'s drifting community.\\n\\nVin Diesel makes a cameo appearance as Dominic Toretto at the end of the film.\\n\\nFast & Furious (2009) [ edit ]\\n\\nDominic Toretto and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent Brian O\\'Conner are forced to work together to avenge the murder of Toretto\\'s lover Letty Ortiz and apprehend drug lord Arturo Braga.\\n\\nThe film is set five years after the events of The Fast and the Furious, and before Tokyo Drift, with Sung Kang reprising his role as Han Lue from the latter film.[3]\\n\\nFast Five (2011) [ edit ]\\n\\nDom, Brian, along with Dom\\'s sister Mia plan a heist to steal $100 million from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes while being pursued for arrest by U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs.\\n\\nThe film is also set before the events of Tokyo Drift.

Cohen secured a deal with producer Neal H. Moritz for an untitled action film for Universal Pictures, and approached Walker and asked him to suggest his \"dream\" action film; Walker suggested a mash-up of the films Days of Thunder (1990) and Donnie Brasco (1997).[28] Soon thereafter, Cohen and Moritz brought him the Vibe magazine article \"Racer X\" by Ken Li, published in May 1998, which detailed underground street racing operating in New York City,[1] and suggested a story set to follow Walker as an undercover cop tasked with infiltrating the world of underground street racing in Los Angeles inspired by the article.[28] Upon hearing this, Walker signed on immediately; finding his co-star proved difficult. The studio warmed toward the idea of Timothy Olyphant in the role of Dominic Toretto, due to the success of the blockbuster Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), but he declined. Moritz persisted on Vin Diesel following his performance in Pitch Black (2000), with Diesel accepting after proposing several script changes. Moritz had difficulty choosing between the titles Racer X (after the article), Redline, Race Wars and Street Wars, but was ultimately inspired by a documentary on American International Pictures, which included the 1954 film The Fast and the Furious. Moritz was traded use of some stock footage to its director, Roger Corman, in exchange for a license to use the title.[29][30] Upon release in June 2001, the film shattered box office expectations and a sequel was green-lit.[28]\\n\\nDiesel declined to return for the sequel, saying that the screenplay was inferior to its predecessor. Cohen also declined the sequel, opting to develop the film XXX (2002), which starred Diesel in the lead role. To account for these changes, Universal commissioned the writers to create a standalone sequel with Walker in the lead and brought in John Singleton as the new director. Filming was delayed by a year and the production location shifted to Miami. Tyrese Gibson, who worked with Singleton on the film Baby Boy (2001), was hired as Walker\\'s new co-star and was the first entry in the series to feature long-running cast member Ludacris.[28]\\n\\nUniversal attempted to bring back Diesel for the third installment, but he again declined due to other projects and a dislike for the script.[31] After failing to secure the returns of Walker or any other member of the original cast, Universal ordered a reboot of the franchise. Screenwriter Chris Morgan subsequently attempted to revive the series primarily for car enthusiasts, introducing new characters, focusing on a car-related subculture and moving the series to Tokyo; Japan contains one of the world\\'s largest automotive industries. It is the first film in the series to start its tradition of filming in locations outside the United States.[32] Moritz returned and hired director Justin Lin, having been impressed with Lin\\'s work for the film Better Luck Tomorrow (2002), which shared similar elements with Tokyo Drift. The third film marked the first appearance in the Fast & Furious franchise of Han Lue, portrayed by Sung Kang, a character who originated from Lin\\'s Better Luck Tomorrow. Although the relation between Better Luck Tomorrow and Fast & Furious was originally left unaddressed, both Lin and Kang repeatedly confirmed during the following years that it was the same character, and that Better Luck Tomorrow doubled as Han\\'s origin story, retroactively making the film part of the Fast & Furious continuity.[33][34] Moreover, with Tokyo Drift, the series was able to bring Diesel in for a cameo appearance, in exchange for letting the actor\\'s production company acquire the rights to the Riddick character.[35][36] The third film was the least financially successful of the franchise, received lukewarm reception and left the future of the franchise in limbo.[37]\\n\\nAway from the franchise, Diesel made a string of box office or critical flops, including The Chronicles of Riddick (2004), The Pacifier (2005) and Find Me Guilty (2006), but his cameo in Tokyo Drift generated interest in reviving the series.[37] After signing Diesel and confirming the return of Lin, Universal worked to track the first film\\'s original co-stars and re-signed Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster in mid-2008.[37] Walker was initially reluctant to rejoin the franchise after six years, but Diesel assured him that film would be considered the first \"true\" sequel.[28] Morgan returned to write after the critical praise for the character Han Lue. Given the apparent death of the character in the third film, the timeline of the franchise was altered to account for his appearance.[31] With the emphasis on car culture toned down, the fourth film, Fast & Furious, was a commercial success. Although critical reception was mixed, it reinvigorated the franchise, as well as the star power of Diesel and Walker.\\n\\nDwayne Johnson joined the cast in Fast Five and headlined the first spin-off film.\\n\\nIn 2011, Fast Five was released. While developing the film, Universal completely departed from any street racing elements prevalent in previous films, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls and the heist. Fast Five was initially conceived to conclude the franchise, but following positive reception at test screenings, alongside its eventual strong critical and commercial performance, Universal proceeded to develop a sixth film. Furthermore, the film is noted for the addition of Dwayne Johnson to the cast, whose performance was critically praised.[39][40][41]\\n\\nIn late 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that Universal was approaching the sixth and seventh installment with a single storyline running through both films, with Morgan envisaging themes of freedom and family, but later shifted to account for the studio\\'s wishes to incorporate elements of espionage. Lin revealed that he had, after discussions with Diesel, storyboarded, previsualized and began editing a twelve-minute finale for Fast & Furious 6, before filming was completed on Fast Five. Upon release, the sixth film became the highest-grossing film in the series, grossing $788 million worldwide.[43]\\n\\nUniversal lacked a major event film for 2014 and rushed Furious 7 into pre-production in mid-2013 due to its status as a bankable asset. Lin decided not to return to direct the seventh film, as he was still performing post-production on Fast & Furious 6. James Wan, primarily known for horror films, took over directorial duties.[44] On November 30, 2013, Walker died in a single-vehicle crash, with filming only half-completed. Following Walker\\'s death, filming was delayed for script rewrites, and his brothers, Caleb and Cody, were used as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes.[45] The script rewrites completed the story arcs of both Walker and Brewster\\'s characters. Visual effects company Weta Digital was hired to re-create Walker\\'s likeness. Ultimately, the film\\'s delays saw it being released in April 2015,[46] where it became the highest-grossing film in the franchise, grossing $1.5 billion. It was also the most critically successful, with praise being aimed at the film\\'s action sequences and its emotional tribute to Walker.[43][47]\\n\\nThe toll of multiple re-shoots dissuaded Wan from returning to the franchise and Universal hired F. Gary Gray to helm the eighth film, The Fate of the Furious. This film was to begin a new trilogy to conclude the franchise.[48][49] The film was released in 2017 and received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the performances and action sequences, but criticized the storyline and the long running time. It was an unabashed commercial success, grossing over $1.2 billion worldwide. Universal later announced that final two films will be released in May 2020 and April 2021, with Lin returning to direct.[50] It was announced that Brewster would reprise her role as Mia Toretto, while screenwriter Daniel Casey was hired for the ninth film; F9 is the first film since Tokyo Drift not to be written by Morgan.[51] Pre-production began in February 2019 in London,[52] and filming began in June and concluded in November.[53] John Cena was cast as the film\\'s villain, portraying Jakob Toretto, Dom\\'s brother.[54] Moreover, Sung Kang returned as Han, while the film is the first to star Helen Mirren and saw Lucas Black reprise his role as Sean Boswell from Tokyo Drift.[55][56] F9 was originally scheduled to be theatrically released on May 22, 2020, but was pushed back a year to April 2, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[57] It was then pushed back to May 28, 2021, and finally released in the United States on June 25.[58][59] It broke pandemic box office records, grossing $726 million worldwide.\\n\\nFast X was designed to be the final movie of the franchise which later evolved in becoming a two part finale. Justin Lin was brought back to direct both movies but left the process early on due to on set differences with Vin Diesel.[60] Louis Leterrier was then hired as his replacement to direct the two part finale. At Universal\\'s request, the two part finale was changed to a trilogy.[20]\\n\\nSpin-off films [ edit ]\\n\\nIn 2015, Diesel announced that potential spin-offs were in the early stages of development.[21][61] In 2019, Diesel announced a film that will focus on the women characters from the Fast & Furious and mentioned that there are three spin-off films in development. Nicole Perlman, Lindsey Beer and Geneva Robertson-Dworet will serve as co-screenwriters on the project.[22][62]\\n\\nThe first spin-off, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, was announced in 2018 and starred Johnson and Jason Statham.[63] In late 2017, Variety reported Morgan had written the script,[64] while David Leitch would direct. Originally, the ninth film in the main series was supposed to be released in April 2019, followed by the tenth in April 2021. Instead, Universal opted to proceed with the spin-off, to occupy the 2019 release date. This caused tensions between Johnson, Diesel and Gibson,[65] with Gibson responding through an Instagram post, criticizing Johnson for causing the ninth film to be delayed.[63] Johnson called out his male co-stars after completing The Fate of the Furious in a now deleted Instagram post saying, \"My male co-stars however are a different story. Some conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don\\'t. The ones that don\\'t are too chicken shit to do anything about it anyway. Candy asses. When you watch this movie next April and it seems like I\\'m not acting in some of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling—you\\'re right.\"[66] Johnson later cited scheduling issues as his refusal to participate in F9 and later confirmed he will not be in the final two Fast and Furious movies (Fast X and its sequel) despite Vin Diesel asking him to return in an Instagram post, with Johnson calling Diesel\\'s attempt \"manipulative\".[67] However, Johnson made a cameo appearance at the end of Fast X which indicated his potential involvement in its sequel.[68]\\n\\nIn October 2018, long-term producer Neal H. Moritz filed a lawsuit against Universal Pictures for breach of oral contract and committing promissory fraud after the distributor removed him as lead producer for Hobbs & Shaw. Furthermore, it was revealed in May 2019 that Universal dropped Moritz from all future Fast & Furious installments.[69] His lawsuit was settled in September 2020,[70] and Moritz would later return to the series with F9.\\n\\nTelevision series [ edit ]\\n\\nIn April 2016, DreamWorks Animation was acquired by NBCUniversal for $3.8 billion, with the acquisition including a first look deal with the company to produce animated projects based on or with films under the Universal Pictures banner. In April 2018, streaming service Netflix green-lit the series Fast & Furious Spy Racers, with Bret Haaland, Diesel, Tim Hedrick and Morgan as executive producers and Hedrick and Haaland as showrunners. The series premiered on December 26, 2019, and ran for six seasons.\\n\\nReception [ edit ]\\n\\nBox office performance [ edit ]\\n\\nEach film is linked to the \"Box office\" section of its article.\\n\\nCritical and public response [ edit ]\\n\\nFilm Critical Public Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic CinemaScore[85] The Fast and the Furious 54% (156 reviews)[86] 58 (34 reviews)[87] B+ 2 Fast 2 Furious 36% (162 reviews)[88] 38 (36 reviews)[89] A− The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift 38% (140 reviews)[90] 45 (32 reviews)[91] A− Fast & Furious 29% (178 reviews)[92] 46 (28 reviews)[93] A− Fast Five 78% (209 reviews)[94] 66 (41 reviews)[95] A Fast & Furious 6 71% (214 reviews)[96] 61 (39 reviews)[97] A Furious 7 81% (281 reviews)[47] 67 (50 reviews)[98] A The Fate of the Furious 67% (315 reviews)[99] 56 (45 reviews)[100] A Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw 67% (349 reviews)[101] 60 (54 reviews)[102] A− F9 59% (316 reviews)[103] 58 (54 reviews)[104] B+ Fast X 56% (306 reviews)[105] 56 (59 reviews)[106] B+\\n\\nMusic [ edit ]\\n\\nSoundtracks [ edit ]\\n\\nSingles [ edit ]\\n\\nOther media [ edit ]\\n\\nTheme park attractions [ edit ]\\n\\nAfter the release of Tokyo Drift in 2006, Universal began introducing theme park attractions. From 2006 to 2013, The Fast and the Furious: Extreme Close-Up attraction was included as part of the Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood. The tour\\'s tram would enter a small arena, which featured a demonstration of prop vehicles being manipulated by articulated robotic arms.[109][110][111][112]\\n\\nA new attraction, Fast & Furious: Supercharged, opened as part of the Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood in 2015. The tour\\'s tram passes the Dodge Chargers used in the fifth film, as riders are shown a video of Luke Hobbs, who informs them a high-valued witness sought by Owen Shaw is on the tram. The tram enters a warehouse party, where the cast appear via a Pepper\\'s ghost effect, before the party is shut down by the FBI and the tram moves into a motion simulator where a chase sequence ensues, led by Roman Pearce, Letty Ortiz and Dominic Toretto.[113][114] A similar attraction opened at Universal Studios Florida in 2018.[115] In the queue, guests pass through a garage with memorabilia from the films before getting a video call from Tej Parker and Mia Toretto inviting them to a party. Guests board \"party buses\", where they get the video message from Hobbs and the ride proceeds as it does in the Hollywood version.[116]\\n\\nOn July 12, 2023, it was announced that a Fast & Furious-themed roller coaster was being built at Universal Studios Hollywood.[117]\\n\\nTour [ edit ]\\n\\nIn 2018, Universal announced Fast & Furious Live, a series of live shows which combine stunt driving, pyrotechnics and projection mapping to recreate scenes from the films and perform other stunts. During production, thousands of stunt performers and drivers auditioned and were required to undergo a four-month training camp if selected.[118] Additionally, parkour athletes and stunts requiring both drivers and parkour practitioners, also featured.[119]\\n\\nThe tour was panned by critics. Ryan Gilbey of The Guardian wrote \"large sections of seating were closed off; entire rows in the rest of it were empty\" and \"the only danger in Fast & Furious Live is the audience might die of carbon monoxide poisoning. Or boredom.\"[120] Adam White of The Daily Telegraph gave the show a two out of five rating, commenting that \"Fast & Furious Live often feels like an elaborate if lethargic playground game, one hinging almost entirely on imagination.\"[121][122]\\n\\nThe tour was a financial failure; the show\\'s production company entered administration in summer 2018 and all the cars and equipment was auctioned off in 2019.[123]\\n\\nVideo games [ edit ]\\n\\nA video game based on the first movie was planned to be released in November 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and in 2004 for the Xbox, but was cancelled for unknown reasons. It was planned to be developed by Genki and published by Vivendi Universal Games under the Universal Interactive label.[124]\\n\\nThe arcade racing game The Fast and the Furious, loosely based on the first installment, was released in 2004 by Raw Thrills.[125] It was designed by Eugene Jarvis, the creator of the Cruis\\'n series of games, and shared much of the same gameplay. It was ported to the Wii without the Fast & Furious license as Cruis\\'n in 2007. Two arcade sequels followed, The Fast and the Furious: Drift in 2007, drawing on elements of the third film, and Fast & Furious: SuperCars in 2010.[126][127]\\n\\nA mobile game of the same name was also released in 2004, followed by a sequel, 2 Fast 2 Furious, released in the same year exclusively for mobile phones based on the second film. Several other games have been released for iOS and Android devices, including Fast & Furious, Fast Five, Fast & Furious: Adrenaline, Fast & Furious 6: The Game, Fast & Furious: Legacy and Fast & Furious Takedown.\\n\\nThe game The Fast and the Furious was released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable and drew heavy inspiration from Tokyo Drift. It received mixed reviews and sold moderately.\\n\\nFast & Furious: Showdown was released in 2013 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Nintendo 3DS. It marked the second game for consoles, and players controls multiple characters; its narrative was designed around the gap between the fifth and sixth film. It was released to negative reviews and middling financial success.[128]\\n\\nVarious cars, locations and characters from the franchise appeared in the Facebook game Car Town.\\n\\nIn 2015, in a deal with Microsoft Studios, an expansion of Forza Horizon 2 was released for Xbox 360 and Xbox One, titled Forza Horizon 2 Presents: Fast & Furious. It was released to promote Furious 7 and received generally positive reception, although some critics lamented the limited involvement from the titular characters.[129] In 2017, the vehicular soccer game Rocket League released a downloadable content (DLC) pack in promotion for The Fate of the Furious, where players would be able to purchase the Dodge Charger from the film as well as its exclusive wheels and six other new customizations.[130]\\n\\nFast & Furious Crossroads was announced at The Game Awards 2019. The game was originally scheduled for release in May 2020 but was delayed due to logistical problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[131] It was eventually released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on August 7, 2020[132] to largely negative reception.[133]\\n\\nFast & Furious Spy Racers: Rise of SH1FT3R was released in 2021.[134] The 2023 release Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged features crossover themed vehicles from the franchise.[135]\\n\\nToys [ edit ]\\n\\nIn 2002, RadioShack sold ZipZaps micro radio-controlled car versions of cars from the first film,[136] while diecast metal manufacturer Racing Champions released replicas of cars from the first two installments in different scales from 1/18 to 1/64, in 2004.[137]\\n\\nAMT Ertl rivaled the cars released by Racing Champions by producing 1/24-scale plastic model kits in 2004, while Johnny Lightning, under the JL Full Throttle Brand, released 1/64 and 1/24 models of the cars from Tokyo Drift. These models were designed by renowned diecast designer Eric Tscherne. In 2011, Universal licensed the company Greenlight to sell model cars from all films in anticipation for Fast Five.[138] Since 2013, Hot Wheels has released 1/64 models of every car from and since the sixth installment.[139]\\n\\nIn 2020, LEGO produced a set in their Technic line of Dom\\'s Dodge Charger.[140][141][142] In June 2022, The Lego Group unveiled Dominic Toretto\\'s 1970 Dodge Charger R/T which was released as part of the Lego Speed Champions theme on August 1, 2022. It consists of 345 pieces, and includes a Dominic Toretto minifigure. On January 1, 2023, the LEGO Group released Brian O\\'Conner\\'s Nissan Skyline GT-R, also as part of the Speed Champions theme. It consists of 319 pieces, and includes a Brian O\\'Conner minifigure.[143][144][145][146]\\n\\nBoard games [ edit ]\\n\\nGame Salute released a board game based on the series called Fast & Furious: Full Throttle in 2015.[147] It is a card-based game which uses hand management and grid movement to simulate a street race. Players can choose from 12 of the movie characters and customise their cars to create a game advantage. The board game was launched on Kickstarter in April 2015, and was successfully funded. Another game released in 2015 was Atlas Games\\' Fast and Fhtangn, a Fast & Furious cross over with Cthulhu theming.[148] The competitive street racing game uses dice rolling and hand management to control players cars.\\n\\nFunko Games released a board game based on the series called Fast & Furious: Highway Heist in 2021.[149] It is a co-operative game for 2-4 players who choose characters and cars from the films to play through three scenarios - a tank fight, a semi-heist and a helicopter fight.\\n\\nBeyond specifically themed games, a variety of game re-skins have also been released including titles such as Uno Fast & Furious[150] and Fast & Furious Monopoly.\\n\\nFashion [ edit ]\\n\\nIn November 2022, streetwear retailer Dumbgood collaborated with Fast & Furious on a legacy collection featuring t-shirts, shirts, and track pants containing moments and characters from the films. The collection was positively reviewed by Eric Brian of Hypebeast, who wrote, \"Dumbgood\\'s offering is more than just a selection of merch, but is positioned right at the center of car culture and the community around the films\".[151]\\n\\nSocial impact [ edit ]\\n\\nThe series, particularly the first few films, helped popularize the import scene and car tuning.[152][153] According to the LA Times, there are some Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers who blame the Fast & Furious films for popularizing street racing in the city.[154] In August 2022, residents of Los Angeles held a protest against the filming of Fast X, claiming the movies promote illegal street racing.[155][156]\\n\\nThe franchise has been credited with increasing onscreen diversity, and has had broad appeal across multiple demographics. Furious 7 was one of the few American blockbusters which had a majority non-White viewership: 37 percent of its audience was reportedly Latino; 25 percent White; 24 percent Black; and 10 percent was Asian.[157] In a 2011 article about the series\\' casting, Wesley Morris wrote:\\n\\nMovies about race still tend to be self-congratulatory or mine tension for comedy ... The Fast and Furious movies, by contrast, are free of this angst. They\\'re basically a prolonged party for a ring of street-racing urban car thieves.[158]\\n\\nSee also [ edit ]\\n\\nNotes [ edit ]\\n\\n^ Furious 7, his brothers, Caleb and After Paul Walker \\'s death in a single vehicle accident on November 30, 2013, halfway through filming, his brothers, Caleb and Cody , and John Brotherton (who also appears in the film as Sheppard), were hired as stand-ins to film his remaining scenes, with Paul\\'s face, recreated by CGI or archive footage, placed over theirs.\\n\\nReferences [ edit ]\\n\\nWorks cited [ edit ]'}, {'url': 'https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a36716650/fast-and-furious-movies-in-order/', 'text': 'WHETHER YOU\\'RE a Fast and Furious veteran or a newcomer to the series (more on that in a little), what you\\'re really coming for, all things considered, is the utterly out-of-control action and thrills, right? Some of the movies in the Fast and Furious-verse are better than others, but whether they\\'re early films in the series centered on underground street racing, or the later movies, which are....uh, basically about superhero spy heists and stuff, you\\'re coming for the thrills. And if you\\'re new to the whole Fast and Furious deal, it might be a bit confusing to jump right into.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it shouldn\\'t be. Some of the titles are admittedly confusing. How is someone supposed to know that The Fast and the Furious is the first movie, but Fast & Furious is the fourth, and The Fate of the Furious is the eighth (F8. F-8. Fate. Get it?)? It\\'s definitely very confusing.\\n\\nAnd on top of that, the movies end up getting into some timeline trickery, where later movies take place prior to earlier movies. Yes, yes, far too complicated for movies that we\\'re mostly watching for mind-blowing action, car chases, and Vin Diesel being a quasi-superhero. But honestly? Just deal with it. It\\'s worth it.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re new to the Furious-verse and looking to firmly entrench yourself in the family, well, you\\'re in for a great time (and don\\'t be surprised if you find yourself craving a Corona very soon). If you\\'re going to watch all of the movies, we recommend watching them one way and one way only: the order in which they were released.\\n\\nBut for whatever reason, that\\'s not for everyone. Some people like to watch these movies in the chronological timeline order of the movies\\' events. We do not recommend this, especially not for newcomers. But in case you want to, you can.\\n\\nIf you want to watch the Fast and Furious movies in their chronological timeline order, this is your best bet:\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001) 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) Fast & Furious (2009) Fast Five (2011)\\n\\nFast & Furious 6 (2013)\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) Furious 7 (2015) The Fate of the Furious (2017) Hobbs & Shaw (2019) F9: The Fast Saga (2021) Fast X (2023)\\n\\nBut we recommend sticking with release date—the order in which every Fast and Furious movie came out in theaters.\\n\\nEven though the Fast and Furious movies mess around with the over-arching timeline quite a bit (mainly, we think, as a way to keep fan-favorite, chip-snacking speedster Han (Sung Kang) in the mix), we are always going to recommend watching the movies in the order in which they were released as opposed to the chronological timeline order. Just like with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars, and even the Fox X-Men movies, watching these movies in the order in which they were released allows you to have certain shocking reveals that change everything in the way they were intended theatrically. Watching otherwise may erase those thrills, or, even worse, give you a reveal that at the time makes little to no sense.\\n\\nSo, without further ado, here\\'s the order in which you should watch every Fast and Furious movie:\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nThe story starts here. Sure, some day we\\'ll probably get a prequel about Dom, Letty, Mia, and Brian\\'s younger days (and we start down that road in F9), but for now the entire saga of family, cars, and Corona begins with low-level heists, drag racing in the street, and a wildly 2001 nu-metal-influenced soundtrack. The Vin Diesel/Paul Walker bromance begins, and you\\'re in for a wild ride the rest of the way.\\n\\n2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\n2 Fast 2 Furious is the only movie in the main Fast and Furious series to not feature the franchise\\'s face and superstar, Vin Diesel. Still, despite Dom\\'s absence, 2 Fast 2 Furious (which takes place chronologically after The Fast and the Furious) is very silly, very fun, and very action packed. The story also introduces Ludacris as Tej and Tyrese Gibson as Roman, two characters who become crew mainstays over the course of the next... two decades.\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nSo here\\'s where our timeline gets a little... twisted. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift was originally seen as a soft reboot of the Fast and Furious franchise, in that it starred neither Paul Walker nor Vin Diesel (nor Ludacris, nor Michelle Rodriguez, nor Tyrese). Instead, it moved the action to Japan, and introduced a street racer named Han (Sung Kang), who eventually became a fan-favorite. Some... events of this movie.... made keeping Han around in future films a little tricky. Hence some future playing around with timelines. Luckily, the movie ends with quite the Furious-verse cameo, which makes way for the wild timeline that establishes itself in future films.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFast & Furious (2009)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nWe get back to our old pals Dom and Brian with Fast and Furious, the confusingly named fourth installment of the franchise. This is set after 2 Fast 2 Furious, but as we previously alluded, far before The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. We\\'ll get there. The franchise doesn\\'t hit full speed here, but we\\'re getting there.\\n\\nFast Five (2011)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nHere\\'s where things really, really enter a new gear. Fast Five adds The Rock to the movie\\'s repertoire of players, while bringing back Ludacris and Tyrese, along with Gal Gadot, Sung Kang, and the rest of our heroes for... really just an absolutely legendary action movie. Great stuff here, and where the franchise finally realized its most important lesson: bigger, and most outrageous, is without a doubt better.\\n\\nFast & Furious 6 (2013)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nFast & Furious 6 picks up where Fast Five leaves off, in terms of being a supercharged, super team-up heist movie. But a couple new things happen: a new villain family is introduced (Luke Evans as Owen Shaw), and a credits scene with a new franchise character (Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw) reveals that the series\\' main timeline has finally caught up with The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. It may sound confusing, but it\\'s not too bad. This is our last movie with the great Han for a little while.\\n\\nFurious 7 (2015)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nCue the tears. Furious 7 is the last movie in the Fast and Furious series to feature the late Paul Walker (as Brian O\\'Conner), and the movie sends his character off in really as caring and delightful a way as they possibly could have. It helps the Furious 7 legacy that the movie itself might be the best one in the entire series; Deckard Shaw (Statham), in his first starring role in the franchise, is a more-than-formidable adversary, and has some really great fight scenes with both The Rock and Vin Diesel. Some incredible action along the way to the emotional end in this one.\\n\\nThe Fate of the Furious (2017)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nThere\\'s no \\'8\\' in the title (outside of Fate.. F8... get it?), but The Fate of the Furious is the eighth film in the main Fast and Furious series. This one introduces an Academy Award-winner (Charlize Theron) as a villain named Cipher who manages to turn Dom against the family. No Coronas any time soon. At this point, you\\'ve gotta know what you\\'re getting, right?\\n\\nFast and Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nNot technically part of the main Fast and Furious series, but Hobbs & Shaw spins off a comedic action tale on Luke Hobbs (The Rock) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). Yes, Shaw was introduced as a villain and became a hero.... almost shockingly quickly. Whatever. It\\'s fine. Don\\'t think about it. Hobbs & Shaw is a blast, and finds the two titular heroes teaming up with Academy Award-nominee Vanessa Kirby as Shaw\\'s sister, and taking on a super soldier played by Idris Elba. Sold.\\n\\nF9: The Fast Saga (2021)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nThe ninth movie in the main Fast and Furious saga brings back many of our favorite members of the family, and also introduces John Cena as Jakob, a literal member of Dom\\'s family. They\\'re kind of just writing these at random at this point, and, honestly, that\\'s exactly what we want. F9 takes things in the franchise to new heights, quite literally—you\\'ll know what we mean once you check the movie out (they go to space. THEY GO TO SPACE). Han (Sung Kang) is also back. We\\'ll let you figure that one out on your own. Great movie.\\n\\nFast X (2023)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nThis is \"The end of the road begins,\" which makes fittingly little sense for this utterly nonsensical (and completely one-of-a-kind) action franchise. In reality, Fast X is the first of a planned two-part (possibly three-part?) conclusion to the Fast story, one that to this point has spanned more than two decades, dozens of characters, and some of the most nonsensically entertaining moments in all of movies. And since this is the start of what\\'s being sold as a grand finale, we get an Avengers: Infinity War-esque meeting of basically every major character in the Fast franchise. The usual cast of characters from the last couple movies is still around, and characters played by Charlize Theron, John Cena, and Helen Mirren are also back. Newcomers, including Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Reacher\\'s Alan Ritchson, and Jason Momoa as the film\\'s unhinged villain are also here for the fun for the first time.\\n\\nIf you count closely, Fast X has four—FOUR!—Oscar winners among its ranks. I\\'m not sure if this is something that should be impressive or upsetting, but it\\'s a fact and it\\'s something worth noticing. For as bizarre and utterly strange as these movies may be, there\\'s something of a magnetic draw around them. Is Fast X good? Well, you can be the judge of that. But will you be bored? No, you will not be.'}, {'url': 'https://www.ign.com/articles/fast-and-furious-movies-in-order', 'text': 'Over its 22-year history, The Fast and Furious franchise has evolved from relatively modest street racing movies to the pinnacle of over-the-top Hollywood action — an evolution that\\'s led to nearly $2 billion USD at the global box office.\\n\\nThroughout that time, the franchise\\'s twelve films (nine mainline, one spinoff, and two shorts) have woven together a convoluted narrative that\\'s proven a bit difficult to follow.

The Fast and the Furious (2001)\\n\\nThe timeline begins with the franchise\\'s first film, 2001\\'s The Fast and the Furious. The fairly straightforward action plot tasks Paul Walker\\'s undercover cop Brian O\\'Conner with taking down a crew of carjackers led by Vin Diesel\\'s Dom Toretto. Brian gets involved in illegal street racing, befriends Dom, starts dating his sister (Jordan Brewster\\'s Mia Toretto), and ultimately chooses those relationships over his duty as a cop.

The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\\n\\nThe Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious shows how Brian O’Conner, on the run from law enforcement, gets from LA to Miami before the events of 2 Fast 2 Furious. The six-minute short film features no dialogue and a handful of races. It’s nonessential viewing, but it’s here nonetheless.\\n\\nWhere to watch: YouTube\\n\\n3. 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\\n\\nThe series’ only movie without Dom Toretto, 2 Fast 2 Furious introduces Roman Pearce (Tyrese GIbson) and Tej Parker (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges). The story follows Brian O’Connor and Pearce as they go undercover to take down a drug lord in exchange for having their criminal records expunged — a mission that\\'s ultimately successful. It also introduces a new love interest for O’Connor in Eva Mendes’s Monica Fuentes, who only appears again briefly in Fast Five.\\n\\nRead our review of 2 Fast 2 Furious\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime Video to stream/rent, TNT to stream\\n\\n4. Los Bandoleros (2009)\\n\\nThe second of the series’ two short films, Los Bandoleros takes place between Fast 1 and Fast 4, though its exact placement on the timeline is never specified. Written and directed by Vin Diesel, Los Bandoleros is set in the Dominican Republic, where Dom is lying low after the events of Fast 1. In its 20-minute runtime, the film manages to cover an oil war, corrupt politics, and a prison break, culminating in a romantic reunion between Dom and Letty. Chronologically, it’s also the first time we see Sung Kang’s death-defying Han Lue.\\n\\nWhere to watch: Vimeo\\n\\n5. Fast & Furious (2009)\\n\\nNot to be confused with The Fast and the Furious, Fast & Furious is the franchise\\'s fourth mainline film, though it precedes Tokyo Drift (film number three) in the chronology. It\\'s a sequel to Fast 1, set five years later, with Dom and Brian teaming up once again to take down a drug lord and avenge the “death” of Letty. Dom is ultimately arrested and sentenced, though en route to the prison, Brian, Mia, and Tego Leo (Tego Calderon) are seen intercepting the prison bus. Fast & Furious also introduces Gal Gadot’s Gisele Yashar.

Fast Five (2011)\\n\\nFrequent series director Justin Lin’s third Fast movie raised the stakes with massive setpieces and a supersized cast featuring Dwayne Johnson’s Luke Hobbs. Picking up where Fast & Furious left off, Dom heads to Rio de Janeiro with Mia and Brian after escaping his prison transport. A familiar tale unfolds: They steal and race souped-up street cars while on the run from another government agency, this time Luke Hobbs and the DEA.

Fast & Furious 6 (2013)\\n\\nFast 6 begins with Dom and his crew once again on the lam. Hobbs, meanwhile, is looking to take down a mercenary group led by Luke Evans’s Owen Shaw. Hobbs recruits Dom by showing him a picture of Letty, whom Dom believes to be dead, and offering him and his crew amnesty back in the U.S. As always, there are vehicular shenanigans and casualties, though things ultimately end well for the crew, and the franchise carries on.

The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)\\n\\nThe wackiest of the Fast movies timeline-wise is the series’ third movie, which actually takes place between Fast 6 and 7. The first Fast movie directed by Justin Lin features a Dom cameo but largely centers around teenage street racers Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) and Twinkie (Shad \"Bow Wow\" Moss), with series staple Han Lue serving as a mentor to Sean.

It’s also the most well-received critically with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 82% (five points better than runner-up Fast Five). Furious 7 picks up at the end of Tokyo Drift, with Statham’s Deckard Shaw serving as the main villain. It was directed by James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring, Aquaman).\\n\\nThis is the last Fast film with Paul Walker’s Brian O’Conner, as Walker died during the time of its filming.

The spinoff also brings the legendary Idris Elba into the fold as villainous super soldier Brixton Lore.\\n\\nBack in 2020, Johnson said he was working on a Hobbs and Shaw sequel, though he vowed to never again appear in the mainline films due to a feud with Vin Diesel.

The word \"bonkers\" can take on a lot of different meanings, and make sense in a lot of different contexts, so I want to make sure that I\\'m entirely clear with this: when I say the trailer for Hobbs and Shaw (later officially titled Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, for reasons I don\\'t quite understand) looked bonkers, I meant it in a good way. I\\'m not someone who needs every movie to be Parasite or Tár; just as much as those character-driven dramas, I can enjoy a (wildly) dumb action movie that chooses to defy logic and make cinematic choices purely for the purpose of entertaining audiences and telling them one important thing: stop thinking.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s what the long-running Fast series, which began way back in 2001 with The Fast and the Furious is all about. This is a series that embraces its main theme (family), its larger-than-life characters (Vin Diesel\\'s Dom Torretto has essentially become an on-screen spy/racing/action deity), and utterly ridiculous action sequences for one goal and one goal only—to entertain audiences.\\n\\nAnd so after I saw that Hobbs and Shaw trailer, I decided to go on a journey. I decided to watch every single movie in the Fast series, which at the time had been running for nearly two decades. That encompassed my entire summer of 2019, and I\\'ve been aboard with the franchise ever since. All in all, I\\'ve spent 1,376 minutes—or 22 hours and 56 minutes—of my life watching every Fast and Furious movie ever made. Every frame. The entire series. All of it.\\n\\nAfter watching the most recent entry in the series—the truly absurd Fast X, following up on the space venturing of F9: The Fast Saga—it was time to take everything I had experienced, and put it into a new order. Like just about everything else, if there\\'s one thing we love to do with movies and shows when we\\'ve seen them all, it\\'s rank them. And so here I am, doing it again. After all, this series—which has now been going strong for 22 years(!)—started as a low-stakes street racing/petty crime movie, and now is about flesh-eating viruses, venturing into outer space and literal nuclear bombs. Obviously, we needed some reflection.\\n\\nSure, not all of these movies are good. Yes, sometimes the acting might leave... a bit to be desired. But the set pieces? The action? There\\'s something to this series that just sticks, and it\\'s not a surprise that each movie makes approximately a bazillion dollars in its sleep. Each Fast and Furious movie is immensely watchable in its own way—but some are also clearly better than others.\\n\\nSo, without further ado, after the release of Fast X (now ), I give you the complete ranking of every movie in the world-acclaimed Fast and Furious franchise.'}, {'url': 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/07/29/fast-and-furious-movies-order-of-release/10062943002/', 'text': 'Nothing quite gets your adrenaline pumping like the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise.

Here’s what you need to know.\\n\\nWill there be another Fast and Furious movie?\\n\\nFast X isn’t the last movie of the Fast and Furious franchise, as Fast and Furious 11 is already in development.\\n\\nDom (Vin Diesel) and his crew will return for the eleventh time somewhere in 2025. Much of the information is still under wraps, but Fast X director Louis Leterrier will also helm Fast and Furious 11, with Christina Hodson and Oren Uziel penning the script. The upcoming film will see Dom and the others driving into the sunset in what is likely the final installment in the Fast and Furious movie series. Fast X will speed into theaters on May 19.\\n\\n“Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path,” reads the film’s synopsis. “Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything — and everyone — that Dom loves, forever.”\\n\\nThe Fast and Furious franchise is making history in terms of actors reprising the same characters on the big screen. Besides Diesel, Fast X stars Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Ludacris, Nathalie Emmanuel, Sung Kang, John Cena, Jason Statham, and Scott Eastwood. The list of franchise newcomers includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad), Brie Larson (Captain Marvel), and Alan Ritchson (Reacher).\\n\\nLeterrier directed the film from a script penned by Justin Lin and Dan Mazeau, with Lin also attached as a producer.'}, {'url': 'https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/fast-furious-movies-in-order/', 'text': '(Photo by Universal/ courtesy Everett Collection)\\n\\nHow to Watch Fast & Furious Movies In Order\\n\\nYou wouldn’t expect a burly international action franchise like Fast & Furious to have the most complicated timeline.

To watch the F&F movies in chronological order as the events unfolded, you can still start with the first two: The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious. Tokyo Drift is the third in the series but actually set way later in the timeline, so you’ll want to skip that and jump to Fast & Furious, Fast Five, and Fast & Furious 6. Then you can watch Tokyo Drift.\\n\\nAfter that, hop to franchise best Furious 7.

Swerving away from the story of Brian and Dom, the film follows a completely new set of characters led by Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), a student forced to move to Japan to avoid jail time.\\n\\nHere are the movies in chronological order:\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001) 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) Fast & Furious (2009) Fast Five (2011) Fast & Furious 6 (2013) The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) Furious 7 (2015) The Fate of the Furious (2017) Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019) F9 (2021) Fast and Furious 10 (2023)\\n\\nTokyo Drift also marks the first appearance of Han Lue, a fan favourite who (SPOILER ALERT) appeared to be killed in a chase near the end of the film.\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nFortunately, Universal decided Han was so popular he would be resurrected with a clever workaround: all subsequent Fast films would be set before Toyko Drift.\\n\\nThis meant Han was able to return alive and well in Fast & Furious, the next film in the franchise.\\n\\nFast and Furious timeline\\n\\nJust to make things even more complicated, the Fast and Furious franchise also features several high-speed prequels, sequels and midquels. Most of these shorts were created for DVD releases of the original movies, shining light on unknown areas of the high-speed saga’s timeline.\\n\\nMore like this\\n\\nFirst released on the DVD of 2 Fast 2 Furious (the next film on this list), the short film Turbo-Charged Prelude shows exactly how Brian (Paul Walker) went from being an LAPD cop to criminal. The reason is the one you’d expect: after assisting Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) evade law enforcement, Brian himself becomes a wanted man.\\n\\nLos Bandoleros, the next short film, focuses on Dom and was served up to fans via a DVD bonus feature. No, it doesn’t explain how Brian became a fully-fledged FBI agent by the next film but does introduce audiences to Han (Sung Kang), Rico (Don Omar) and Tego (Tego Calderon).

The films are distributed by Universal Pictures.\\n\\nThe first film, based on the 1998 Vibe magazine article \"Racer X\" by Ken Li and written by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer, was released in 2001. It began the original tetralogy of films focused on illegal street racing, which culminated in the film Fast & Furious (2009). The series transitioned towards heists and spying with Fast Five (2011), which was followed by five sequels in that genre, the most recent of which, Fast X, was released on May 19, 2023.\\n\\nUniversal expanded the series to include the spin-off film Hobbs & Shaw (2019), while its subsidiary DreamWorks Animation followed this with the six-season animated streaming television series Fast & Furious Spy Racers (2019–2021).

Two short films that tie into the series have also been released.\\n\\nThe series has been commercially successful.

Cohen secured a deal with producer Neal H. Moritz for an untitled action film for Universal Pictures, and approached Walker and asked him to suggest his \"dream\" action film; Walker suggested a mash-up of the films Days of Thunder (1990) and Donnie Brasco (1997).[28] Soon thereafter, Cohen and Moritz brought him the Vibe magazine article \"Racer X\" by Ken Li, published in May 1998, which detailed underground street racing operating in New York City,[1] and suggested a story set to follow Walker as an undercover cop tasked with infiltrating the world of underground street racing in Los Angeles inspired by the article.[28] Upon hearing this, Walker signed on immediately; finding his co-star proved difficult. The studio warmed toward the idea of Timothy Olyphant in the role of Dominic Toretto, due to the success of the blockbuster Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), but he declined. Moritz persisted on Vin Diesel following his performance in Pitch Black (2000), with Diesel accepting after proposing several script changes. Moritz had difficulty choosing between the titles Racer X (after the article), Redline, Race Wars and Street Wars, but was ultimately inspired by a documentary on American International Pictures, which included the 1954 film The Fast and the Furious. Moritz was traded use of some stock footage to its director, Roger Corman, in exchange for a license to use the title.[29][30] Upon release in June 2001, the film shattered box office expectations and a sequel was green-lit.[28]\\n\\nDiesel declined to return for the sequel, saying that the screenplay was inferior to its predecessor. Cohen also declined the sequel, opting to develop the film XXX (2002), which starred Diesel in the lead role. To account for these changes, Universal commissioned the writers to create a standalone sequel with Walker in the lead and brought in John Singleton as the new director. Filming was delayed by a year and the production location shifted to Miami. Tyrese Gibson, who worked with Singleton on the film Baby Boy (2001), was hired as Walker\\'s new co-star and was the first entry in the series to feature long-running cast member Ludacris.[28]', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious'}), Document(page_content='Universal attempted to bring back Diesel for the third installment, but he again declined due to other projects and a dislike for the script.[31] After failing to secure the returns of Walker or any other member of the original cast, Universal ordered a reboot of the franchise. Screenwriter Chris Morgan subsequently attempted to revive the series primarily for car enthusiasts, introducing new characters, focusing on a car-related subculture and moving the series to Tokyo; Japan contains one of the world\\'s largest automotive industries. It is the first film in the series to start its tradition of filming in locations outside the United States.[32] Moritz returned and hired director Justin Lin, having been impressed with Lin\\'s work for the film Better Luck Tomorrow (2002), which shared similar elements with Tokyo Drift. The third film marked the first appearance in the Fast & Furious franchise of Han Lue, portrayed by Sung Kang, a character who originated from Lin\\'s Better Luck Tomorrow. Although the relation between Better Luck Tomorrow and Fast & Furious was originally left unaddressed, both Lin and Kang repeatedly confirmed during the following years that it was the same character, and that Better Luck Tomorrow doubled as Han\\'s origin story, retroactively making the film part of the Fast & Furious continuity.[33][34] Moreover, with Tokyo Drift, the series was able to bring Diesel in for a cameo appearance, in exchange for letting the actor\\'s production company acquire the rights to the Riddick character.[35][36] The third film was the least financially successful of the franchise, received lukewarm reception and left the future of the franchise in limbo.[37]\\n\\nAway from the franchise, Diesel made a string of box office or critical flops, including The Chronicles of Riddick (2004), The Pacifier (2005) and Find Me Guilty (2006), but his cameo in Tokyo Drift generated interest in reviving the series.[37] After signing Diesel and confirming the return of Lin, Universal worked to track the first film\\'s original co-stars and re-signed Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster in mid-2008.[37] Walker was initially reluctant to rejoin the franchise after six years, but Diesel assured him that film would be considered the first \"true\" sequel.[28] Morgan returned to write after the critical praise for the character Han Lue. Given the apparent death of the character in the third film, the timeline of the franchise was altered to account for his appearance.[31] With the emphasis on car culture toned down, the fourth film, Fast & Furious, was a commercial success. Although critical reception was mixed, it reinvigorated the franchise, as well as the star power of Diesel and Walker.\\n\\nDwayne Johnson joined the cast in Fast Five and headlined the first spin-off film.\\n\\nIn 2011, Fast Five was released. While developing the film, Universal completely departed from any street racing elements prevalent in previous films, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls and the heist. Fast Five was initially conceived to conclude the franchise, but following positive reception at test screenings, alongside its eventual strong critical and commercial performance, Universal proceeded to develop a sixth film. Furthermore, the film is noted for the addition of Dwayne Johnson to the cast, whose performance was critically praised.[39][40][41]', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious'}), Document(page_content=\"In late 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that Universal was approaching the sixth and seventh installment with a single storyline running through both films, with Morgan envisaging themes of freedom and family, but later shifted to account for the studio's wishes to incorporate elements of espionage. Lin revealed that he had, after discussions with Diesel, storyboarded, previsualized and began editing a twelve-minute finale for Fast & Furious 6, before filming was completed on Fast Five. Upon release, the sixth film became the highest-grossing film in the series, grossing $788 million worldwide.[43]\\n\\nUniversal lacked a major event film for 2014 and rushed Furious 7 into pre-production in mid-2013 due to its status as a bankable asset. Lin decided not to return to direct the seventh film, as he was still performing post-production on Fast & Furious 6. James Wan, primarily known for horror films, took over directorial duties.[44] On November 30, 2013, Walker died in a single-vehicle crash, with filming only half-completed. Following Walker's death, filming was delayed for script rewrites, and his brothers, Caleb and Cody, were used as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes.[45] The script rewrites completed the story arcs of both Walker and Brewster's characters. Visual effects company Weta Digital was hired to re-create Walker's likeness. Ultimately, the film's delays saw it being released in April 2015,[46] where it became the highest-grossing film in the franchise, grossing $1.5 billion. It was also the most critically successful, with praise being aimed at the film's action sequences and its emotional tribute to Walker.[43][47]\\n\\nThe toll of multiple re-shoots dissuaded Wan from returning to the franchise and Universal hired F. Gary Gray to helm the eighth film, The Fate of the Furious. This film was to begin a new trilogy to conclude the franchise.[48][49] The film was released in 2017 and received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the performances and action sequences, but criticized the storyline and the long running time. It was an unabashed commercial success, grossing over $1.2 billion worldwide. Universal later announced that final two films will be released in May 2020 and April 2021, with Lin returning to direct.[50] It was announced that Brewster would reprise her role as Mia Toretto, while screenwriter Daniel Casey was hired for the ninth film; F9 is the first film since Tokyo Drift not to be written by Morgan.[51] Pre-production began in February 2019 in London,[52] and filming began in June and concluded in November.[53] John Cena was cast as the film's villain, portraying Jakob Toretto, Dom's brother.[54] Moreover, Sung Kang returned as Han, while the film is the first to star Helen Mirren and saw Lucas Black reprise his role as Sean Boswell from Tokyo Drift.[55][56] F9 was originally scheduled to be theatrically released on May 22, 2020, but was pushed back a year to April 2, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[57] It was then pushed back to May 28, 2021, and finally released in the United States on June 25.[58][59] It broke pandemic box office records, grossing $726 million worldwide.\\n\\nFast X was designed to be the final movie of the franchise which later evolved in becoming a two part finale. Justin Lin was brought back to direct both movies but left the process early on due to on set differences with Vin Diesel.[60] Louis Leterrier was then hired as his replacement to direct the two part finale. At Universal's request, the two part finale was changed to a trilogy.[20]\\n\\nSpin-off films [ edit ]\\n\\nIn 2015, Diesel announced that potential spin-offs were in the early stages of development.[21][61] In 2019, Diesel announced a film that will focus on the women characters from the Fast & Furious and mentioned that there are three spin-off films in development. Nicole Perlman, Lindsey Beer and Geneva Robertson-Dworet will serve as co-screenwriters on the project.[22][62]\", metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious'}), Document(page_content='The first spin-off, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, was announced in 2018 and starred Johnson and Jason Statham.[63] In late 2017, Variety reported Morgan had written the script,[64] while David Leitch would direct. Originally, the ninth film in the main series was supposed to be released in April 2019, followed by the tenth in April 2021. Instead, Universal opted to proceed with the spin-off, to occupy the 2019 release date. This caused tensions between Johnson, Diesel and Gibson,[65] with Gibson responding through an Instagram post, criticizing Johnson for causing the ninth film to be delayed.[63] Johnson called out his male co-stars after completing The Fate of the Furious in a now deleted Instagram post saying, \"My male co-stars however are a different story. Some conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don\\'t. The ones that don\\'t are too chicken shit to do anything about it anyway. Candy asses. When you watch this movie next April and it seems like I\\'m not acting in some of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling—you\\'re right.\"[66] Johnson later cited scheduling issues as his refusal to participate in F9 and later confirmed he will not be in the final two Fast and Furious movies (Fast X and its sequel) despite Vin Diesel asking him to return in an Instagram post, with Johnson calling Diesel\\'s attempt \"manipulative\".[67] However, Johnson made a cameo appearance at the end of Fast X which indicated his potential involvement in its sequel.[68]\\n\\nIn October 2018, long-term producer Neal H. Moritz filed a lawsuit against Universal Pictures for breach of oral contract and committing promissory fraud after the distributor removed him as lead producer for Hobbs & Shaw. Furthermore, it was revealed in May 2019 that Universal dropped Moritz from all future Fast & Furious installments.[69] His lawsuit was settled in September 2020,[70] and Moritz would later return to the series with F9.\\n\\nTelevision series [ edit ]\\n\\nIn April 2016, DreamWorks Animation was acquired by NBCUniversal for $3.8 billion, with the acquisition including a first look deal with the company to produce animated projects based on or with films under the Universal Pictures banner.

If you're going to watch all of the movies, we recommend watching them one way and one way only: the order in which they were released.\\n\\nBut for whatever reason, that's not for everyone. Some people like to watch these movies in the chronological timeline order of the movies' events. We do not recommend this, especially not for newcomers. But in case you want to, you can.\\n\\nIf you want to watch the Fast and Furious movies in their chronological timeline order, this is your best bet:\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001) 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) Fast & Furious (2009) Fast Five (2011)\\n\\nFast & Furious 6 (2013)\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) Furious 7 (2015) The Fate of the Furious (2017) Hobbs & Shaw (2019) F9: The Fast Saga (2021) Fast X (2023)\\n\\nBut we recommend sticking with release date—the order in which every Fast and Furious movie came out in theaters.\\n\\nEven though the Fast and Furious movies mess around with the over-arching timeline quite a bit (mainly, we think, as a way to keep fan-favorite, chip-snacking speedster Han (Sung Kang) in the mix), we are always going to recommend watching the movies in the order in which they were released as opposed to the chronological timeline order. Just like with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars, and even the Fox X-Men movies, watching these movies in the order in which they were released allows you to have certain shocking reveals that change everything in the way they were intended theatrically. Watching otherwise may erase those thrills, or, even worse, give you a reveal that at the time makes little to no sense.\\n\\nSo, without further ado, here's the order in which you should watch every Fast and Furious movie:\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nThe story starts here. Sure, some day we'll probably get a prequel about Dom, Letty, Mia, and Brian's younger days (and we start down that road in F9), but for now the entire saga of family, cars, and Corona begins with low-level heists, drag racing in the street, and a wildly 2001 nu-metal-influenced soundtrack. The Vin Diesel/Paul Walker bromance begins, and you're in for a wild ride the rest of the way.\\n\\n2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\\n\\nUniversal\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a36716650/fast-and-furious-movies-in-order/'}), Document(page_content=\"2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\n2 Fast 2 Furious is the only movie in the main Fast and Furious series to not feature the franchise's face and superstar, Vin Diesel. Still, despite Dom's absence, 2 Fast 2 Furious (which takes place chronologically after The Fast and the Furious) is very silly, very fun, and very action packed. The story also introduces Ludacris as Tej and Tyrese Gibson as Roman, two characters who become crew mainstays over the course of the next... two decades.\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nSo here's where our timeline gets a little... twisted. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift was originally seen as a soft reboot of the Fast and Furious franchise, in that it starred neither Paul Walker nor Vin Diesel (nor Ludacris, nor Michelle Rodriguez, nor Tyrese). Instead, it moved the action to Japan, and introduced a street racer named Han (Sung Kang), who eventually became a fan-favorite. Some... events of this movie.... made keeping Han around in future films a little tricky. Hence some future playing around with timelines. Luckily, the movie ends with quite the Furious-verse cameo, which makes way for the wild timeline that establishes itself in future films.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFast & Furious (2009)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nWe get back to our old pals Dom and Brian with Fast and Furious, the confusingly named fourth installment of the franchise. This is set after 2 Fast 2 Furious, but as we previously alluded, far before The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. We'll get there. The franchise doesn't hit full speed here, but we're getting there.\\n\\nFast Five (2011)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nHere's where things really, really enter a new gear. Fast Five adds The Rock to the movie's repertoire of players, while bringing back Ludacris and Tyrese, along with Gal Gadot, Sung Kang, and the rest of our heroes for... really just an absolutely legendary action movie. Great stuff here, and where the franchise finally realized its most important lesson: bigger, and most outrageous, is without a doubt better.\\n\\nFast & Furious 6 (2013)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nFast & Furious 6 picks up where Fast Five leaves off, in terms of being a supercharged, super team-up heist movie. But a couple new things happen: a new villain family is introduced (Luke Evans as Owen Shaw), and a credits scene with a new franchise character (Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw) reveals that the series' main timeline has finally caught up with The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. It may sound confusing, but it's not too bad. This is our last movie with the great Han for a little while.\\n\\nFurious 7 (2015)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nCue the tears. Furious 7 is the last movie in the Fast and Furious series to feature the late Paul Walker (as Brian O'Conner), and the movie sends his character off in really as caring and delightful a way as they possibly could have. It helps the Furious 7 legacy that the movie itself might be the best one in the entire series; Deckard Shaw (Statham), in his first starring role in the franchise, is a more-than-formidable adversary, and has some really great fight scenes with both The Rock and Vin Diesel. Some incredible action along the way to the emotional end in this one.\\n\\nThe Fate of the Furious (2017)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nThere's no '8' in the title (outside of Fate.. F8... get it?), but The Fate of the Furious is the eighth film in the main Fast and Furious series. This one introduces an Academy Award-winner (Charlize Theron) as a villain named Cipher who manages to turn Dom against the family. No Coronas any time soon. At this point, you've gotta know what you're getting, right?\\n\\nFast and Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019)\\n\\nUniversal\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a36716650/fast-and-furious-movies-in-order/'}), Document(page_content='Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nNot technically part of the main Fast and Furious series, but Hobbs & Shaw spins off a comedic action tale on Luke Hobbs (The Rock) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). Yes, Shaw was introduced as a villain and became a hero.... almost shockingly quickly. Whatever. It\\'s fine. Don\\'t think about it. Hobbs & Shaw is a blast, and finds the two titular heroes teaming up with Academy Award-nominee Vanessa Kirby as Shaw\\'s sister, and taking on a super soldier played by Idris Elba. Sold.\\n\\nF9: The Fast Saga (2021)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nThe ninth movie in the main Fast and Furious saga brings back many of our favorite members of the family, and also introduces John Cena as Jakob, a literal member of Dom\\'s family. They\\'re kind of just writing these at random at this point, and, honestly, that\\'s exactly what we want. F9 takes things in the franchise to new heights, quite literally—you\\'ll know what we mean once you check the movie out (they go to space. THEY GO TO SPACE). Han (Sung Kang) is also back. We\\'ll let you figure that one out on your own. Great movie.\\n\\nFast X (2023)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nThis is \"The end of the road begins,\" which makes fittingly little sense for this utterly nonsensical (and completely one-of-a-kind) action franchise. In reality, Fast X is the first of a planned two-part (possibly three-part?) conclusion to the Fast story, one that to this point has spanned more than two decades, dozens of characters, and some of the most nonsensically entertaining moments in all of movies. And since this is the start of what\\'s being sold as a grand finale, we get an Avengers: Infinity War-esque meeting of basically every major character in the Fast franchise. The usual cast of characters from the last couple movies is still around, and characters played by Charlize Theron, John Cena, and Helen Mirren are also back. Newcomers, including Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Reacher\\'s Alan Ritchson, and Jason Momoa as the film\\'s unhinged villain are also here for the fun for the first time.\\n\\nIf you count closely, Fast X has four—FOUR!—Oscar winners among its ranks. I\\'m not sure if this is something that should be impressive or upsetting, but it\\'s a fact and it\\'s something worth noticing. For as bizarre and utterly strange as these movies may be, there\\'s something of a magnetic draw around them. Is Fast X good? Well, you can be the judge of that. But will you be bored? No, you will not be.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a36716650/fast-and-furious-movies-in-order/'}), Document(page_content=\"Over its 22-year history, The Fast and Furious franchise has evolved from relatively modest street racing movies to the pinnacle of over-the-top Hollywood action — an evolution that's led to nearly $2 billion USD at the global box office.\\n\\nThroughout that time, the franchise's twelve films (nine mainline, one spinoff, and two shorts) have woven together a convoluted narrative that's proven a bit difficult to follow.

The Fast and the Furious (2001)\\n\\nThe timeline begins with the franchise's first film, 2001's The Fast and the Furious. The fairly straightforward action plot tasks Paul Walker's undercover cop Brian O'Conner with taking down a crew of carjackers led by Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto. Brian gets involved in illegal street racing, befriends Dom, starts dating his sister (Jordan Brewster's Mia Toretto), and ultimately chooses those relationships over his duty as a cop. The first film also introduces viewers to series staple Michelle Rodriguez, who plays Letty Ortiz, Dom's love interest.\\n\\nRead our review of The Fast and the Furious.\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime Video to stream/rent, TNT to stream\\n\\n2. The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\\n\\nThe Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious shows how Brian O’Conner, on the run from law enforcement, gets from LA to Miami before the events of 2 Fast 2 Furious. The six-minute short film features no dialogue and a handful of races. It’s nonessential viewing, but it’s here nonetheless.\\n\\nWhere to watch: YouTube\\n\\n3. 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\\n\\nThe series’ only movie without Dom Toretto, 2 Fast 2 Furious introduces Roman Pearce (Tyrese GIbson) and Tej Parker (Chris “Ludacris” Bridges). The story follows Brian O’Connor and Pearce as they go undercover to take down a drug lord in exchange for having their criminal records expunged — a mission that's ultimately successful. It also introduces a new love interest for O’Connor in Eva Mendes’s Monica Fuentes, who only appears again briefly in Fast Five.\\n\\nRead our review of 2 Fast 2 Furious\\n\\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime Video to stream/rent, TNT to stream\\n\\n4. Los Bandoleros (2009)\\n\\nThe second of the series’ two short films, Los Bandoleros takes place between Fast 1 and Fast 4, though its exact placement on the timeline is never specified. Written and directed by Vin Diesel, Los Bandoleros is set in the Dominican Republic, where Dom is lying low after the events of Fast 1. In its 20-minute runtime, the film manages to cover an oil war, corrupt politics, and a prison break, culminating in a romantic reunion between Dom and Letty. Chronologically, it’s also the first time we see Sung Kang’s death-defying Han Lue.\\n\\nWhere to watch: Vimeo\\n\\n5.

Fast & Furious (2009)\\n\\nNot to be confused with The Fast and the Furious, Fast & Furious is the franchise\\'s fourth mainline film, though it precedes Tokyo Drift (film number three) in the chronology. It\\'s a sequel to Fast 1, set five years later, with Dom and Brian teaming up once again to take down a drug lord and avenge the “death” of Letty. Dom is ultimately arrested and sentenced, though en route to the prison, Brian, Mia, and Tego Leo (Tego Calderon) are seen intercepting the prison bus.

Picking up where Fast & Furious left off, Dom heads to Rio de Janeiro with Mia and Brian after escaping his prison transport.

The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)\\n\\nThe wackiest of the Fast movies timeline-wise is the series’ third movie, which actually takes place between Fast 6 and 7. The first Fast movie directed by Justin Lin features a Dom cameo but largely centers around teenage street racers Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) and Twinkie (Shad \"Bow Wow\" Moss), with series staple Han Lue serving as a mentor to Sean.

It’s also the most well-received critically with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 82% (five points better than runner-up Fast Five). Furious 7 picks up at the end of Tokyo Drift, with Statham’s Deckard Shaw serving as the main villain. It was directed by James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring, Aquaman).\\n\\nThis is the last Fast film with Paul Walker’s Brian O’Conner, as Walker died during the time of its filming.

The word \"bonkers\" can take on a lot of different meanings, and make sense in a lot of different contexts, so I want to make sure that I\\'m entirely clear with this: when I say the trailer for Hobbs and Shaw (later officially titled Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, for reasons I don\\'t quite understand) looked bonkers, I meant it in a good way. I\\'m not someone who needs every movie to be Parasite or Tár; just as much as those character-driven dramas, I can enjoy a (wildly) dumb action movie that chooses to defy logic and make cinematic choices purely for the purpose of entertaining audiences and telling them one important thing: stop thinking.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s what the long-running Fast series, which began way back in 2001 with The Fast and the Furious is all about. This is a series that embraces its main theme (family), its larger-than-life characters (Vin Diesel\\'s Dom Torretto has essentially become an on-screen spy/racing/action deity), and utterly ridiculous action sequences for one goal and one goal only—to entertain audiences.\\n\\nAnd so after I saw that Hobbs and Shaw trailer, I decided to go on a journey. I decided to watch every single movie in the Fast series, which at the time had been running for nearly two decades. That encompassed my entire summer of 2019, and I\\'ve been aboard with the franchise ever since. All in all, I\\'ve spent 1,376 minutes—or 22 hours and 56 minutes—of my life watching every Fast and Furious movie ever made. Every frame. The entire series. All of it.\\n\\nAfter watching the most recent entry in the series—the truly absurd Fast X, following up on the space venturing of F9: The Fast Saga—it was time to take everything I had experienced, and put it into a new order. Like just about everything else, if there\\'s one thing we love to do with movies and shows when we\\'ve seen them all, it\\'s rank them. And so here I am, doing it again. After all, this series—which has now been going strong for 22 years(!)—started as a low-stakes street racing/petty crime movie, and now is about flesh-eating viruses, venturing into outer space and literal nuclear bombs. Obviously, we needed some reflection.\\n\\nSure, not all of these movies are good. Yes, sometimes the acting might leave... a bit to be desired. But the set pieces? The action? There\\'s something to this series that just sticks, and it\\'s not a surprise that each movie makes approximately a bazillion dollars in its sleep. Each Fast and Furious movie is immensely watchable in its own way—but some are also clearly better than others.\\n\\nSo, without further ado, after the release of Fast X (now ), I give you the complete ranking of every movie in the world-acclaimed Fast and Furious franchise.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/g28645511/fast-and-furious-movies-ranked/'}), Document(page_content='Nothing quite gets your adrenaline pumping like the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise.

Will Fast 10 be the last movie in the Fast and Furious franchise? Or will fans see the Toretto family reunite again in the future? Here’s what you need to know.\\n\\nWill there be another Fast and Furious movie?\\n\\nFast X isn’t the last movie of the Fast and Furious franchise, as Fast and Furious 11 is already in development.\\n\\nDom (Vin Diesel) and his crew will return for the eleventh time somewhere in 2025. Much of the information is still under wraps, but Fast X director Louis Leterrier will also helm Fast and Furious 11, with Christina Hodson and Oren Uziel penning the script. The upcoming film will see Dom and the others driving into the sunset in what is likely the final installment in the Fast and Furious movie series. Fast X will speed into theaters on May 19.\\n\\n“Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path,” reads the film’s synopsis. “Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything — and everyone — that Dom loves, forever.”\\n\\nThe Fast and Furious franchise is making history in terms of actors reprising the same characters on the big screen. Besides Diesel, Fast X stars Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Ludacris, Nathalie Emmanuel, Sung Kang, John Cena, Jason Statham, and Scott Eastwood. The list of franchise newcomers includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad), Brie Larson (Captain Marvel), and Alan Ritchson (Reacher).\\n\\nLeterrier directed the film from a script penned by Justin Lin and Dan Mazeau, with Lin also attached as a producer.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.comingsoon.net/guides/news/1287501-is-fast-x-the-last-movie-fast-and-furious-franchise-final-one-10'}), Document(page_content='(Photo by Universal/ courtesy Everett Collection)\\n\\nHow to Watch Fast & Furious Movies In Order\\n\\nYou wouldn’t expect a burly international action franchise like Fast & Furious to have the most complicated timeline. Then again, who predicted the 2001 original about some humble street racing would witness its sequels dragging bank vaults across asphalt, jumping out of planes, sliding off submarines, and likely soon making contact with alien life in deep space?\\n\\nSome of these Fast & Furious sequels are set later in the timeline, even though they were made earlier than others. To watch the F&F movies in chronological order as the events unfolded, you can still start with the first two: The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious. Tokyo Drift is the third in the series but actually set way later in the timeline, so you’ll want to skip that and jump to Fast & Furious, Fast Five, and Fast & Furious 6. Then you can watch Tokyo Drift.\\n\\nAfter that, hop to franchise best Furious 7. Follow it up with The Fate of the Furious and spin-off Hobbs & Shaw and then the latest: F9 and Fast X.\\n\\nSee below for the full list if you want to watch Fast & Furious movies in order!

      "[Document(page_content='American media franchise\\n\\nFast & Furious (also known as The Fast and the Furious) is an American media franchise centered on a series of action films that are largely concerned with street racing, heists, spies, and family. The franchise also includes short films, a television series, toys, video games, live shows, and theme park attractions. The films are distributed by Universal Pictures.\\n\\nThe first film, based on the 1998 Vibe magazine article \"Racer X\" by Ken Li and written by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer, was released in 2001. It began the original tetralogy of films focused on illegal street racing, which culminated in the film Fast & Furious (2009). The series transitioned towards heists and spying with Fast Five (2011), which was followed by five sequels in that genre, the most recent of which, Fast X, was released on May 19, 2023.\\n\\nUniversal expanded the series to include the spin-off film Hobbs & Shaw (2019), while its subsidiary DreamWorks Animation followed this with the six-season animated streaming television series Fast & Furious Spy Racers (2019–2021). Soundtrack albums have been released for all the films, as well as compilation albums containing existing music heard in the films. Two short films that tie into the series have also been released.\\n\\nThe series has been commercially successful. It is Universal\\'s biggest franchise and the seventh highest-grossing film series, with a combined gross of over $7 billion.[2] Critical reception for the first four films was mixed until the fifth and later films, which were more positively received. Outside of the films, Fast & Furious has been the focus of other media, including attractions at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida, live shows, commercials, toys, and video games.\\n\\nFilms [ edit ]\\n\\nReleased [ edit ]\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious (2001) [ edit ]\\n\\nBrian O\\'Conner, an LAPD officer, goes undercover in the street racing world to investigate a group of unknown truck hijackers, believed to be led by Dominic Toretto.\\n\\n2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) [ edit ]\\n\\nBrian O\\'Conner and Roman Pearce team up to go undercover for the U.S. Customs Service to bring down drug lord Carter Verone in exchange for the erasure of their criminal records.\\n\\nThis is the only film in the main series without Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto.\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) [ edit ]\\n\\nHigh school car enthusiast Sean Boswell is sent to live in Tokyo with his father and finds solace in the city\\'s drifting community.\\n\\nVin Diesel makes a cameo appearance as Dominic Toretto at the end of the film.\\n\\nFast & Furious (2009) [ edit ]\\n\\nDominic Toretto and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent Brian O\\'Conner are forced to work together to avenge the murder of Toretto\\'s lover Letty Ortiz and apprehend drug lord Arturo Braga.\\n\\nThe film is set five years after the events of The Fast and the Furious, and before Tokyo Drift, with Sung Kang reprising his role as Han Lue from the latter film.[3]\\n\\nFast Five (2011) [ edit ]\\n\\nDom, Brian, along with Dom\\'s sister Mia plan a heist to steal $100 million from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes while being pursued for arrest by U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs.\\n\\nThe film is also set before the events of Tokyo Drift. Despite not appearing in the film, a picture of Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz is seen in the mid-credits scene, where Eva Mendes reprises her role as Monica Fuentes from 2 Fast 2 Furious.\\n\\nFast & Furious 6 (2013) [ edit ]\\n\\nDominic Toretto, Brian O\\'Conner and their team are offered amnesty for their crimes by Luke Hobbs, in exchange for helping him take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw, one member of which is Toretto\\'s former lover Letty Ortiz.\\n\\nThe film is the final film to be set before the events of Tokyo Drift. Jason Statham appears as Owen\\'s older brother Deckard Shaw in the credits scene, seemingly killing Han, as seen in Tokyo Drift.\\n\\nFurious 7 (2015) [ edit ]', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious'}), Document(page_content=\"2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\n2 Fast 2 Furious is the only movie in the main Fast and Furious series to not feature the franchise's face and superstar, Vin Diesel. Still, despite Dom's absence, 2 Fast 2 Furious (which takes place chronologically after The Fast and the Furious) is very silly, very fun, and very action packed. The story also introduces Ludacris as Tej and Tyrese Gibson as Roman, two characters who become crew mainstays over the course of the next... two decades.\\n\\nThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nSo here's where our timeline gets a little... twisted. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift was originally seen as a soft reboot of the Fast and Furious franchise, in that it starred neither Paul Walker nor Vin Diesel (nor Ludacris, nor Michelle Rodriguez, nor Tyrese). Instead, it moved the action to Japan, and introduced a street racer named Han (Sung Kang), who eventually became a fan-favorite. Some... events of this movie.... made keeping Han around in future films a little tricky. Hence some future playing around with timelines. Luckily, the movie ends with quite the Furious-verse cameo, which makes way for the wild timeline that establishes itself in future films.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFast & Furious (2009)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nWe get back to our old pals Dom and Brian with Fast and Furious, the confusingly named fourth installment of the franchise. This is set after 2 Fast 2 Furious, but as we previously alluded, far before The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. We'll get there. The franchise doesn't hit full speed here, but we're getting there.\\n\\nFast Five (2011)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nHere's where things really, really enter a new gear. Fast Five adds The Rock to the movie's repertoire of players, while bringing back Ludacris and Tyrese, along with Gal Gadot, Sung Kang, and the rest of our heroes for... really just an absolutely legendary action movie. Great stuff here, and where the franchise finally realized its most important lesson: bigger, and most outrageous, is without a doubt better.\\n\\nFast & Furious 6 (2013)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nFast & Furious 6 picks up where Fast Five leaves off, in terms of being a supercharged, super team-up heist movie. But a couple new things happen: a new villain family is introduced (Luke Evans as Owen Shaw), and a credits scene with a new franchise character (Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw) reveals that the series' main timeline has finally caught up with The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. It may sound confusing, but it's not too bad. This is our last movie with the great Han for a little while.\\n\\nFurious 7 (2015)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nCue the tears. Furious 7 is the last movie in the Fast and Furious series to feature the late Paul Walker (as Brian O'Conner), and the movie sends his character off in really as caring and delightful a way as they possibly could have. It helps the Furious 7 legacy that the movie itself might be the best one in the entire series; Deckard Shaw (Statham), in his first starring role in the franchise, is a more-than-formidable adversary, and has some really great fight scenes with both The Rock and Vin Diesel. Some incredible action along the way to the emotional end in this one.\\n\\nThe Fate of the Furious (2017)\\n\\nUniversal\\n\\nThere's no '8' in the title (outside of Fate.. F8... get it?), but The Fate of the Furious is the eighth film in the main Fast and Furious series. This one introduces an Academy Award-winner (Charlize Theron) as a villain named Cipher who manages to turn Dom against the family. No Coronas any time soon. At this point, you've gotta know what you're getting, right?\\n\\nFast and Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019)\\n\\nUniversal\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a36716650/fast-and-furious-movies-in-order/'})]\n"
