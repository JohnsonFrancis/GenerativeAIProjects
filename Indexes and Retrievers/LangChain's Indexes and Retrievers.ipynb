    "#### What occurred behind the scenes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we employed a so-called \"stuff chain\" (refer to CombineDocuments Chains). Stuffing is one way to supply information to the LLM. Using this technique, we \"stuff\" all the information into the LLM's prompt. However, this method is only effective with shorter documents, as most LLMs have a context length limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a similarity search is conducted using the embeddings to identify matching documents to be used as context for the LLM. Although it might not seem particularly useful with just one document, we are effectively working with multiple documents since we \"chunked\" our text. Preselecting the most suitable documents based on semantic similarity enables us to provide the model with meaningful knowledge through the prompt while remaining within the allowed context size.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this exploration, we have discovered the significant role that indexes and retrievers play in improving the performance of Large Language Models when handling document-based data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The system becomes more efficient in finding and presenting relevant information by converting documents and user queries into numerical vectors (embeddings) and storing them in specialized databases like Deep Lake, which serves as our vector store database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The retriever's ability to identify documents that are closely related to a user's query in the embedding space demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing the overall language understanding capabilities of LLMs.\n",
    "A Potential Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This method has a downside: you might not know how to get the right documents later when storing data. In the Q&A example, we cut the text into equal parts, causing both useful and useless text to show up when a user asks a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Including unrelated information in the LLM prompt is detrimental because:\n",
    "\n",
    "    It can divert the LLM's focus from pertinent details.\n",
    "    It occupies valuable space that could be utilized for more relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "A DocumentCompressor abstraction has been introduced to address this issue, allowing compress_documents on the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ContextualCompressionRetriever is a wrapper around another retriever in LangChain. It takes a base retriever and a DocumentCompressor and automatically compresses the retrieved documents from the base retriever. This means that only the most relevant parts of the retrieved documents are returned, given a specific query.\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular compressor choice is the LLMChainExtractor, which uses an LLMChain to extract only the statements relevant to the query from the documents. To improve the retrieval process, a ContextualCompressionRetriever is used, wrapping the base retriever with an LLMChainExtractor. The LLMChainExtractor iterates over the initially returned documents and extracts only the content relevant to the query. \n",
